## Omg Hey 🌸

I'm Kavish. Nice of you to visit my lil page 🌱

I've worked in software for over 9 years now and have touched a lot of different areas, probably too many of them. So much so that I'm going back to basics and making some simple apps from little ideas I think of randomly, while also learning new technologies. Essentially doing what I can to keep learning and growing as a software developer while still having fun with it

Current obsessions include Tauri 🌻, Vue 🌵 and Godot 🎮 \
Look at this lil focus timer I made in Tauri. And this Spotify data explorer with some Vue. Or a Pokemon Battle Info app to help skip the type charts

Coz why use tools someone else made and perfected that I can access instantly when I can make silly versions of them over a few weeks

Other things I've made include
- A VS Code extension to convert color types: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kavish.hex-to-hsl
- The pomo timer mentioned above: https://focus-coffee.netlify.app/
- A browser extension to hit the Jump To Recipe button so you can skip to the important bit in food blogs: [Chrome/Brave/Edge](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/jump-to-recipe/hfpigmpejgbffkiocfedombfjooanabj?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jump-to-recipe/)
- some others that don't have nice links or production deployments but I use regularly, like discord/twitch bots, task tracking apps, etc

I work at Oracle building Jenkins pipelines and other tools for various teams to build their projects using various technologies. It's more fun and interesting than it sounds given the breadth of languages and technologies I get to work with, but also means I have to deal with everyone's bugs and support issuse. Before that I used to work at Cerner making frontend apps in React and Ruby on Rails with some more Java backend work.

My free time also goes to reading, watercoloring and gaming. Here's some random links that relate to those
